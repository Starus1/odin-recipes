    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            In a small bowl, use a fork to whisk the eggs with a pinch of salt and 
            pepper until homogenous (the whites are one with the yolks and not too much 
            air is incorporated). Whisk in the fines herbes.
        </li>
        <li>
            In a small 6- or 8-inch skillet, melt the butter over medium heat and immediately 
            add the eggs. Continuously stir with a heatproof rubber spatula in one hand, while 
            moving the skillet around with the other hand. Occasionally swipe the outer edges and 
            bring them in until you have small and creamy curds, about 1Â½ minutes. Remove from 
            the heat and let sit 10 to 20 seconds.
        </li>
        <li>
            Start to roll the omelet by lifting the pan's handle, tilting the pan downward and away 
            from you. Run the rubber spatula underneath the top edge of the omelet, nudging it to roll 
            it downward until it reaches the bottom of the skillet.
        </li>
        <li>
            Slide a plate under the skillet and tip the skillet so the omelet gently falls onto the plate, 
            seam-side down and pointed at each end. Garnish with a pinch of fines herbes and serve.
        </li>
    </ol>
